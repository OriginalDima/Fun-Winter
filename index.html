            <p>Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter Olympic and Paralympic sport that involves descending
                a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.</p>
            <h4>Styles:</h4>
            <p>"Freeriding" is a style without a set of governing rules or set course, typically on natural, un-groomed
                terrain. The basic allows for various snowboarding styles in a fluid motion and spontaneity through
                naturally rugged terrain. It can be similar to freestyle with the exception that no man-made features
                are utilized. See also Backcountry snowboarding.</p>
            <p>"Freestyle" snowboarding is any riding that includes performing tricks. In freestyle, the rider utilizes
                natural and man-made features such as rails, jumps, boxes, and innumerable others to perform tricks. It
                is a popular all-inclusive concept that distinguishes the creative aspects of snowboarding, in contrast
                to a style like alpine snowboarding.</p>

            <p>Skiing can be a means of transport, a recreational activity or a competitive winter sport in which the
                participant uses skis to glide on snow. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the
                International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).</p>
            <h4>Types:</h4>
            <p>"Alpine" Also called "downhill skiing", Alpine skiing typically takes place on a piste at a ski resort.
                It is
                characterized by fixed-heel bindings that attach at both the toe and the heel of the skier's boot. Ski
                lifts, including chairlifts, bring skiers up the slope. Backcountry skiing can be accessed by
                helicopter, snowcat, hiking and snowmobile. Facilities at resorts can include night skiing, apr√®s-ski,
                and glade skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school. Alpine skiing branched off
                from the older Nordic type of skiing around the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was not
                necessary to walk any longer. Alpine equipment has specialized to the point where it can now only be
                used with the help of lifts.</p>
            <p>"Nordic" disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping, which both use bindings that attach
                at the toes of the skier's boots but not at the heels. Cross-country skiing may be practiced on groomed
                trails or in undeveloped backcountry areas. Ski jumping is practiced in certain areas that are reserved
                exclusively for ski jumping.</p>
            <p>"Telemark" skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned discipline, which is named after the
                Telemark region of Norway. It uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are
                attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier's heel to be raised throughout the turn.

            <div class="main-article__columns">
                <p>The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and
                    winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a
                    variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition
                    with more than 200 nations participating.</p>
                <p>The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the
                    Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. Their
                    creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th
                    century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic
                    Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the
                    governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and
                    authority.</p>

                    <p>Yes, you read that right. A fellow named Sherman Poppen, an engineer living in Muskegon,
                        Michigan, strapped two skis together and added some rope for steering. His wife called it a
                        snurfer, or snow surfing.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-weight">Skiing was originally a form of transportation in Europe before it became a sport.</h2>
                    <p>The oldest documented evidence of skiing is found in the region of Norway and Sweden from
                        primitive carvings dating back to 5000 B.C. Until the 1800‚Äôs skiing was primarily used only for
                        transport, it was after the turn of the 18th century that it became a recreational sport.
                        Commercially the popularity of skiing holidays took off in the 19th century which increased
                        substantially during the mid-1900s until today.</p>

            <h3 class="main-bottom-article__title font-weight">International Ski Federation rules for ski and snowboarding conduct
            </h3>
            <p>1) Respect for others on skis and snowboards: A skier or snowboarder must behave in such a way that
                he does not endanger or prejudice others.</p>
            <p>2) Control of speed and behavior: A skier or snowboarder must move in control. They must adapt their
                speed and manner of skiing or snowboarding to their personal ability and to the prevailing
                conditions of terrain, snow and weather, as well as to the density of traffic.</p>
            <p>3) Choice of ski or snowboarding route: A skier or snowboarder coming from behind (who are higher up
                the slope) must choose his or her route in such a way that he or she does not endanger skiers or
                snowboarders ahead.</p>
            <p>4) Overtaking during skiing or snowboarding exercise: A skier or snowboarder may overtake another
                skier or snowboarder above or below, and to the right or to the left, provided that he or she leaves
                enough space for the overtaken skier or snowboarder to make any voluntary or involuntary movement.
            </p>
            <p>5) Entering, starting and moving upwards: A skier or snowboarder either: entering a marked run,
                starting again after stopping, or moving upwards or crossing on the slopes, must look up and down
                the slopes so that he or she can move without endangering themselves or others.</p>
            <p>6) Stopping on the piste: Unless absolutely necessary, a skier or snowboarder must avoid stopping on
                the piste in narrow places or where visibility is restricted. After a fall in such a place, a skier
                or snowboarder must move clear of the piste as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>7) Walking up or downhill for skiing or snowboarding: A skier or snowboarder either climbing or
                descending on foot must keep to the side of the piste.</p>
            <p>8) Respect for signs and markings: A skier or snowboarder must respect all signs and markings. This
                includes slope information, weather conditions, and the conditions of the slopes and snow.</p>
            <p>9) Assistance following ski or snowboarding accidents: At accidents, every skier or snowboarder is
                duty bound to assist.</p>
            <p>10) Identification after a ski or snowboarding accident: Any witness, whether a responsible party or
                not, must exchange names and addresses following an accident. They must identify themselves to Piste
                Control, as well as to any others involved in the ski or snowboarding accident.</p>
